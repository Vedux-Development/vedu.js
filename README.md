# vedu.js

Hello, welcome to the NPM/GitHub page for `vedu.js`!

This package is designed to make [`discord.js`](https://npmjs.org/discord.js) easier for beginners of javascript in general.<br>
If you're having trouble, please, come to our [Discord Server](#Vedux-Development-servers) and say hi!<br>

###  How to set up.

You'll need Node.js and NPM installed for this, obviously.<br>

Open up your terminal and run the following command:<br>
```npm i --save vedu.js```

This will install the package. 
From there, you can go ahead to the documentation pages for the methods and properties of the client. <br>

Unsure of what to do? Join the support server.<br>
